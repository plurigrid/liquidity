Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies across the files in the "liquidity_metasploit" library could include:

1. **Common Vulnerabilities**: This is likely a collection of known Solidity vulnerabilities that are shared across multiple files. These could be represented as data schemas or exported variables.

2. **Attack Tactics**: These are strategies for exploiting the aforementioned vulnerabilities. They could be represented as functions or methods that are shared across multiple files.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**: This is the learning algorithm that is used to optimize the attack tactics over time. It could be represented as a class or a set of functions that are shared across multiple files.

4. **Gym Environment**: This is the simulation environment where the reinforcement learning algorithm is trained. It could be represented as a class or a set of functions that are shared across multiple files.

5. **Test Cases**: These are likely a set of predefined scenarios for testing the functionality of the common vulnerabilities, attack tactics, reinforcement learning algorithm, and gym environment. They could be represented as functions or methods that are shared across multiple test files.

6. **Setup and Requirements**: These files would contain shared dependencies in terms of required Python packages or specific setup instructions necessary for the library to function correctly.

Please note that without more specific information about the functionality and implementation of the "liquidity_metasploit" library, it's difficult to provide a more detailed list of shared dependencies.
